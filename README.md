# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my work for **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**, a course offered by Harvard University. The course explores the fundamental concepts behind modern artificial intelligence and provides hands-on experience implementing AI techniques using Python.

Throughout the course, a wide range of topics are covered, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, uncertainty, optimization, machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. Each unit combines theoretical foundations with practical programming exercises designed to reinforce understanding through real implementations.

This repository is structured by course units, with each unit containing its corresponding exercises and documentation.
