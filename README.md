## 📚 Course Topics and Exercises

Each folder corresponds to a main topic in the course. Inside each, you will find one or more exercises:

**[0 - Search](./0-search)**

This lesson introduces uninformed and informed search algorithms. It focuses on representing problems as graphs and exploring paths using algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). These techniques are essential for solving search problems efficiently in AI.
