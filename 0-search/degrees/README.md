# 📽️ Degrees

This project is the first exercise of the first lesson, "0 Search", from the course *CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python*. 

In this exercise, a graph search algorithm is implemented to determine the shortest connection between two actors based on movies they have starred in. Inspired by the *Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon* game, it explores how closely linked two actors are within the film industry.

## 🚀 How it Works

The program models actors and movies as a graph:

- Each **actor** is a node.
- Each **movie** is an edge connecting actors who appeared together.
- Using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, it finds the shortest path from one actor to another.

Example usage:

```
python3 degrees.py small
```

You will be prompted to enter two actor names. The program then outputs the degrees of separation and the list of movies and co-stars that connect them.
