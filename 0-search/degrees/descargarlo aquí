# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe

This project is the second exercise of the first lesson, "0 Search", from the course *CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python*.

In this exercise, an AI agent is implemented to play optimally in a game of Tic Tac Toe using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI evaluates possible moves to ensure it never loses and plays the best possible action for its turn.

## 🚀 How it Works

The program simulates a standard 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board:

- The board is represented as a 2D list.
- The current player is determined by counting the existing Xs and Os.
- The `minimax` algorithm recursively explores all possible future moves.
- The AI chooses the move with the optimal utility:  
  `1` for X win, `-1` for O win, `0` for tie.

The AI always plays optimally, ensuring the best outcome for its turn.

To run the graphical interface:

```
python3 runner.py
```

You can play against the AI by selecting whether to be X or O.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This exercise explicitly forbids any modifications to `runner.py`.  
> All logic must be implemented in `tictactoe.py` only.
